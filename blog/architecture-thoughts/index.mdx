For those considering the options and why to use one technology over another.

I'm in the process of creating an e-commerce site and wanted to keep a separation of concerns from the business content / marketing side of things.

To do this I am thinking of having 2 front ends (platform and blog) connected to 1 back end to handle the business logic.

Stacks:

- e-commerce front end: Next

- blog: Gatsby + GraphQL (comes as default data layer with Gatsby)

- back end: NestJs + Postgres

The blog would be more of a marketing / landing page / funnel and the platform would provide the service.

Architecturally does this make sense? I'm a noob at architecture so would like some advice if this is going to cause me problems in the future.
