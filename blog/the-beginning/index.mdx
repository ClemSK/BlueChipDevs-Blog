# Start here

If you've made it here: welcome, dear internaut!

## Tech stack 📚

I've built this site with Gatsby because:

- Its' a fast static site generator,
- Easy to use and great plug-in ecosystem to get stuff done - again - fast 🏎️ ,
- Uses MDX (markdown) for writing content and a template to convert the MDX to HTML (Sweet! I love programatic stuff 🤩 ).
  - This means I don't need to leave my code editor to create and publish content, a big win for me! 🏆
- Good SEO so content can be easily found on Google,
- Handles images well for performant load times / time to first paint,
- Hosted with Gatsby Cloud which is optimised the framework for faster deploys.

Comes with a GraphQL data layer, so I guess I'm a GraphQL user now 🤷‍♂️ .

I used the following resources to get started:

- [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-1/) - Just be aware it's not super up to date, the code still works though.
- [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/)

## Why start a blog? 📝

You might be like me and have an entrepreneurial mind and need a space to speak freely. I wanted to start sharing ideas again and I thought this would be a fast fun project to pull together.

My main reasons for writing are:

- I love tech and making things, so crafting my own blog a blog is a good outlet,
  - I get to make the container and write the words that go on the page, YAY! 🥳
- Getting in the habit of writing regularly again,
- Share and process my thoughts ,
- Helping others learn with me,
- Documenting this journey so others can maybe get inspired or learn from my mistakes.

## What I'm looking to do?

I'm writing this blog while also in the process of building an API with [NestJs](https://docs.nestjs.com/) 😺 and [Postgres](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) 🐘 that will be linked to an ecommerce or service platform. In the longer term the blog will share markting info, but I'm still figuring that out too.

I plan to publish regularly (my publish cadence is still TBD) and create a newsletter to share ideas as well as let notifying you when new content is published.

Come back to hear what I've been up to 😊

## Other things I'm working on

As mentioned above, I'm creating an API, when the time comes I can use the back-end with 2 different front ends:

- this blog and
- the platform.

The separation of concerns is useful: having a fast static-site blog and another front-end for the platform will mean that I'm not creating one bloated site and each can have it's bespoke configuration.

Happy holidays, I hope to see you here again soon 🤘
